# Achtung Kurve but online

Wanted to build a game for playing with my friends, but I don't know that much about real time data. i mean how do I do that?, how does it work?
So I decided to make some research, and I ended up finding WebSockets 🛠️. I still don't how it works but wanna learn it. Let's give it a try. 🙌🙌

💡The idea is to recreate the game [Achtung Kurve](https://achtung.life/ "Web game I am getting inspired from") but to be able to play it online. My friends and I used to play it during school on one keyboard and we always ended up laughing to much from it.
